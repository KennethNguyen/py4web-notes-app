## Description

A full-stack notes CRUD web application created using Py4Web, Vue.js, built-in DAL (database abstraction layer) connection to SQLite, and Bulma. 

This was the last assignment from my Web Applications course with free reigns to design from scratch how the user interface would be like. There were specific functionalities required such as users can only see their own notes, authentication of deleting notes and signing in, users are able to create and delete their notes with no problem, and notes are ordered by most recently updated.

## Utilized
* Framework: Py4Web, Vue.js, Bulma CSS
* JavaScript ES6 | Python3 | CSS | SQL

## Installation

Currently not available for ease of use to the public since it isn't deployed to the cloud. However, if you have the Py4Web application, you could clone this into the /apps folder. Run py4web as normally and the project folder should show up in the dashboard.
